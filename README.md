# Welcome to my semester file hub
Hi visitor
I am Ask/FaNzu, whatever suits your boat. I am studying computer science and have therefor alot of files and projects going on. The file hub is made up of 3 different folders, which represents the classes i have this year. And specific projects, that might involve multiple classes at once. 
The semester is going to mainly involve around server orianted problems and solutions. Such as _api, client server (web) and more to be introduced_. 


# Files
Here is my 3 different class folders

**Programmering**
In this folder is my programmering related stuff, such as daily solutions, home projects and more. It is probably here you'll find the most interesting stuff.

**Systemudvikling**
In this folder you'll find my system related stuff, such as diagrams, use cases, project plans and more. It is likely here you'll find the most important stuff for a developer. 
_Translated Systemudvikling means software development_

**Teknologi** 
In this folder you'll everything related to the technologies we are using, need to know about, or that i am just interested in. It is here you'll find the stuff i find the most fun to play with.
_Translated Teknologi means technology_
